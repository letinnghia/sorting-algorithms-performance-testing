# sorting-algorithms-performance-testing

This repository contains a source code to test the performances of four sorting algorithms: heapsort, mergesort, quicksort, std::sort (in C++).

To run the program, first set up an environment with a C++ compiler and a Python Interpreter.

After that run these commands in your command line interfaces (CLIs):

`git clone https://github.com/letinnghia/sorting-algorithms-performance-testing.git`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then go to src/main.cpp and execute it.
