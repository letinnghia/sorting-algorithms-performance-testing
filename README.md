# sorting-algorithms-performance-testing
This repository contains source code to test the performances of four sorting algorithms: heapsort, mergesort, quicksort, std::sort (in C++).\n
To run the programme, first set up an environment with a C++ compiler and a Python interpreter.\n
After that run these commands in your command line interface:\n
"git clone https://github.com/letinnghia/sorting-algorithms-performance-testing.git"\n
"pip install -r requirements.txt"\n
Then go to main.cpp and execute it.\n
