# sorting-algorithms-performance-testing

This repository contains source code to test the performances of four sorting algorithms: heapsort, mergesort, quicksort, std::sort (in C++).

To run the programme, first set up an environment with a C++ compiler and a Python interpreter.

After that run these commands in your command line interfaces:

"git clone https://github.com/letinnghia/sorting-algorithms-performance-testing.git"

"pip install -r requirements.txt"

Then go to main.cpp and execute it.
