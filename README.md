# sorting-algorithms-performance-testing

This repository contains a source code to test the performances of four sorting algorithms: heapsort, mergesort, quicksort, std::sort (in C++).


To run the program, first set up an environment with a C++ Compiler and a Python Interpreter.

Then run these commands in your command line interface (CLI):

`git clone https://github.com/letinnghia/sorting-algorithms-performance-testing.git`

`cd sorting-algorithms-performance-testing`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then go to src/main.cpp, compile and execute it.
